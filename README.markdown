== Welcome ! 

This repository contains the files to the application that I am building, using the Ruby on Rails framework.

Eventually it is going to consist in an application that will enable tutors and their students to share whatever they want : questions/answers thanks to posting, file share, chat

This will enable communication in a different context than within a social network where you have many other temptations that studying or looking for more knowledge.

So far the functionalities achieved are: 
- profiling : user account, login and logout
- posting : the user can post a sequence of messages to his "wall" where they appear after submission
- following : working on it. The models are there, but the web interface is in the works

Thanks for your interest !
